# 1.) 2 user PROFILEs
# 2.) Random chore generator to pull from dictionary, 1 dictionary for each child
# 3.) Option to physically select a chore instead of randomize
# 4.)"Accept to do chore" and "Decline to Rerun" buttons
# 5. ***maybe*** Stores the total amount earned from the chores to each user, even when not in use
# 6.) ***maybe***resets totals one every 7 days
# clear memory button
# 2 user PROFILEs
